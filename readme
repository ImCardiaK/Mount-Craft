Mount&Craft is a Minecraft SKRIPT that allows players to summon and ride their mounts with a simple right-click on an item.

90% of the SKRIPT settings can be modified directly from the file SUPER EASILY!
Commented lines will guide you through making any changes.

The SKRIPT does not allow you to add MORE mounts than those included.
You have 6 default mounts.
Upon request, if you would like more mounts, I can assist via DISCORD.

Each mount uses a variant of the default Minecraft horses, visible on this site

Each mount’s gallop speed can also be modified!
(In reality, the horse has an infinite speed potion effect that can also be SUPER EASILY adjusted in the file.)

For any requests, suggestions, or bug reports, the Discord is available!

I don’t think the Skript requires any add-ons. But just in case, here are the ones I use on my development server, where the Skript works (1.20.4):
> Skript 2.9.3
> SkRayFall 1.9.28
> SkQuery 4.1.9
> Skelett 2.0.9
> SkBee 3.6.1
